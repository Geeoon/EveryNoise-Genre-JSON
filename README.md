# EveryNoise-Genre-JSON
This Python script will grab the latest list of genres from the Every Noise at Once project and automatically format it in JSON.  Feel free to use it in your projects.

The output object has two keys: "genres" and "total"; "genres" contains an array of strings which are the genres, and "total" contains a number representing the total number of genres.

Every Noise at Once is a project that describes itself as "an algorithmically-generated, audio-annotated, dynamically evolving map of the music genre space."
