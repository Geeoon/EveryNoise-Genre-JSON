# EveryNoise-Genre-JSON
This Python script will grab the latest list of genres from the Every Noise at Once project and automatically format it in JSON for you to use in your own projects.  Feel free to use it in your projects.  Credit would be appreciated, but it's not necessary!

Every Noise at Once is a project that describes itself as "an algorithmically-generated, audio-annotated, dynamically evolving map of the music genre space."
